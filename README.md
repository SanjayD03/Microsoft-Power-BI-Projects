## Bank Analysis Report
## 🎯 Objective
The report dives into critical loan metrics, tracking dynamic changes over time to:
- Monitor loan portfolio health
- Uncover lending trends
- Support strategic decisions and risk assessment

## 🏦 Business Problem
The bank needed a centralized dashboard to monitor:
- The volume and status of loan applications
- Amounts funded and received
- Risk indicators such as interest rates and DTI
- Good vs. bad loan performance across time and region
## 🧾 Data Source
The data was stored in **Microsoft SQL Server**, consisting of:
- 38,576 loan applications
- Fields like application date, loan status, funded amount, amount received, interest rate, DTI, term, and location

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Data storage, preprocessing, and querying
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard creation and DAX analysis
- **DAX** – Custom measures and time intelligence
- **Power Query** – Data transformation and modeling
- **Excel** – For initial data verification
- **PySpark (in future expansion)** – Potential for handling large-scale data

## ✅ Recommendations
- **Optimize approval criteria** for applicants with DTI > 15, as these correlate with higher default rates.
- **Increase staff** during December–January to manage peak application load.
- **Expand operations** in regions with consistently high repayment rates (use map visuals for targeting).
- Use insights to **refine lending strategy** and reduce bad loan ratio from 13.8% to under 10%.
